# BREASTCANCER.ML
This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to diagnose whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. We'll use the Scikit-learn library in Python to preprocess the data, create a classification model, and evaluate its performance.

Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. It includes 30 features such as radius, texture, smoothness, and more. The target variable is binary, indicating whether the tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).
Getting Started
1.Clone the Repository
2.Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.
3.Run the Code: Run the main script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Project Structure
breast_cancer_diagnosis.py: The main script that loads the dataset, performs data preprocessing, builds the classification model, and evaluates its performance.
requirements.txt: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
Results
The script will output the accuracy of the trained model on the test set and a classification report that includes precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class. This will help you understand the performance of the model in more detail.

Further Improvements
Experiment with different classification algorithms provided by Scikit-learn.
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
Explore feature selection techniques to identify the most important features.
Implement cross-validation to assess the model's generalization ability.
